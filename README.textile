h1. SoundPainter

for openFrameworks 0061.

Paint program where you draw your musical timeline, and put sampledots on it. Each color dot represents a sample.You can put many sampledots with the same color on the canvas. But SoundPainter does not play the samples itself. OSC messages are sent to a listening Application (e.g. Pure data, SuperCollider, Max/MSP), which plays the sound files.

The OSC messages are:
- Sample trigger:   /play #sample number#
- Dot position:     /fx positionx #actual x# positiony #actual y#
